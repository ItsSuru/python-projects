# Vibrant circle

  Its a very small project that I have made using 'turtle' library.
  
# Tools 

  I personally used 'pycharm' IDE for this and also tried it into 'jupyter notebook'.
  If it shows the error you must install turtle first,. for that open any command prompt and type : $pip install turtle
  
  If you want to run it into Jupyter nb., then try this following command : 
  
  $ pip install ipyturtle 
  
  $ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyturtle
  
  (Execute both command)
