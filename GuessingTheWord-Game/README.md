I made this in python, 
used 'pycharm' IDE to make this.
Its a simple guessing game where you have to guess the word, hints will be given if you failed to do so.
If you guessed the perfect word you'll win.

## How it Works

In this game you have to guess the word on the base of how many "-" are there 
If you cant figure it out you will get 4 more chance. 

(1) If your word's char matches with the position of the word which you are 
    guessing then it will give you an hint.
Now you have 3 more chances to guess the word, if again you are wrong 
step (1) will get repeated till the last chance.
If still you can't manage to find the word you'll lose.

If you guessed it correctly you'll win.
